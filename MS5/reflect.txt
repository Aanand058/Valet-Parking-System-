This is reflection part of the whole project(milestones) for fall 2022.


Firstly, All the previous citations of all modules which are included in the modules files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Menu.cpp :
--> During this project, I was facing problem in the indendation part, so i took help from one of my friend
who is not a student of Seneca college. He helped me to implement the indentation output correctly in the display function to
make it work properly. The name of my friend is Ashutosh Jha, email: jhaashutosh.aj@gmail.com


Vehicle.h:
--> In this part I got lots of errors, one was about strcmp, which my professor helped me to fix and
another in the  const char* getLicensePlate() const; where i was not putting const at first
and it was showing error return value type does not match the function type.
For solving that I tried placing const at front and it worked.

I was not able to implent the Uppercase of Licence Plate, My friend Ka Ho Chow, email: kchow25@myseneca.ca
helped me and provided the code for uppercase:
I placed this code in the Utils module.


	const char* toUpperCase(char* string) {
		// ref: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/string-uppercase-lowercase-c-plus-plus
		for (int i = 0; i < strlen(string); i++) {
			string[i] = toupper(string[i]);
		}
		return string;
	}



Update on Vehicle.h: operator=

1 . Getting conditional jumps in the vehicle.cpp, to solve the issue Chi Fai Lo helped me to
initialize everything to safe empty state in the vehicle.h file of the attributes.
	char m_plate[8 + 1]{};
		int m_pSpotNum =0;

This solved the problem for the conditional jumps

		}
		return string;
	}

Update on Vehicle.cpp: operator=
1. Added this->setCsv(toCopyFrom.isCsv());

2. I was facing memory leaks problem in the matrix, to solve i took help from my friend Chi Fai Lo, email: clo36@myseneca.ca

In the Vehicle.cpp, he helped to change these implementation in the opeator=
if(!isEmpty())
				delete[] this->m_makeModel;
to check the state of vehicle which solved the problem of leaks.

During this project, Me along with some of my friends work on this project to make it complete. I have already mentioned in the upper 
part. I am again delclaring that during this project I worked these friends:

Rubal preet Singh, nrubalpreet-singh@myseneca.ca
Chow Ka Ho, kchow25@myseneca.ca 
Chi Fai Lo, clo36@myseneca.ca 
Ashutosh Jha, jhaashutosh.aj@gmail.com



Working on this project was pretty interesting along with stressfull, complteting the project before the deadline was the a real stress.
I got to learn about very new things in this project such as how to prevent conditional jumps issue of initialization, deleting the 
dynamically created this with very careful checking the conditions, the rule of three implementation for dynamic resources, the importance of having small modules and methods along with good
implementation of encapsulation, inheritence and polymorphism. One of the biggest help in this semester was the Visual Studio Debugger tool 
which helped me alot to learn about what is on going in the code with what is the variables addresses and values at every line of the code. 
The debugger helped a lot to where should I make my changes in the code to make it run correctly. Also, I want to thanks to the professor who 
helped me along this semester for solving my doubts and helping me to complete the workshops and project.

Regarding the Milestone 5 (Parking module):

Working on this module, the loadDataFile() method was really hard for me, I was not getting the correct implementation and the program will 
run in a endless loop, even I was using flag values. I was also getting leaks problem because I was delete the memory multipple time inside the 
same method, to solve this issue I implemented that part in the destructor. After trying many times, I took help from my friend Ashutosh Jha, where
he helped me to built this method with his coding skills. The issue was I was not changing the setCsv() value to true and    this->p_noOfParkedVehicles++. 
Also, I have placed the loadStatus to wrong place where the loop was not working properly.  
Making of the new Vehicle code looks repeated twice, I also tried making new method, but it didn't worked out well, giving me leaks and wrong outputs.
The help from my friend and some google search helped me to fix this issue. 

After that there was not much issue,except that i was not setting the setCsv() value correctly in some module, where the debugger and given output played a 
big role to solve the issue. 

Similarly, I was getting the case label issue in the parkVehicle() method, where the Switch statement was not compiling, 
for that I used google and stackoverflow, and I added extra break; and default which solved the compiling issue. This made the code work properly, 
there were some minor issue of incorrect values of p_noOfParkedVehicles in the ++ and -- things which was solved by seeing the correct output. 
One this was really painful is the spelling of Liscense/Liscence to match in the Matrix where some method used C instead of S which took a bit time to run in 
the matrix correctly.
